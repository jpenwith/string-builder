Swift @ViewBuilder but for Strings

StringBuilder ðŸ§±

A lightweight Swift @resultBuilder that lets you assemble a String with the same declarative style as SwiftUIâ€™s @ViewBuilder.

Motivation

Writing multiâ€‘line, conditional strings in Swift often devolves into + concatenations or String(format:) spaghetti. StringBuilder replaces that with a tiny, typeâ€‘safe DSL that is:
	â€¢	Expressive â€“ write strings almost exactly like SwiftUI views.
	â€¢	Safe â€“ fully checked at compile time.
	â€¢	Fast â€“ concatenates in a single pass with joined().

Requirements
	â€¢	SwiftÂ 5.4 or later
	â€¢	iOSÂ 14+ / macOSÂ 11+ / tvOSÂ 14+ / watchOSÂ 7+

Installation

SwiftÂ PackageÂ Manager

dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourâ€‘org/StringBuilder.git", from: "1.0.0")
]

Then import StringBuilder wherever you want to use it.

Quick start

struct Hello: StringBuildable {
    let nationality: String
    let name: String

    @StringBuilder var stringValue: String {
        if nationality == "american" {
            "Howdy"
        } else {
            "Hello"
        }

        " "      // literal space
        name
    }
}

print(Hello(nationality: "american", name: "Liz
